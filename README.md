Itasca Beamer Theme
===================

Itasca is a Beamer theme designed to be functional and visually appealing both in live presentation and personal use.
It uses varying levels of contrast to provide useful information on demand without distracting from the primary slide content.

Requirements
------------

This theme uses the Fira Sans and Fira Mono fonts, freely available from Mozilla.
Both of these fonts must be installed and the presentation must be compiled using XeLaTeX.

Package Options
---------------

Currently, the only package option is the `high-contrast` option which sets the background to pure white and the foreground text to pure black.

License
-------

The Itasca Beamer theme is provided under the MIT License, and may be used, modified, or reproduced as long as the copyright notice is included in all copies and substantial portions of the theme.
There are no restrictions on presentations produced using this theme.
